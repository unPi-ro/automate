### OSX
---

1. install brew
2. install ansible latest/2.7+ with brew
3. load your SSH keys into the ssh-agent (with ssh-add)
4. ready*
5. note: when building a production environment, append -e active=yes to ansible
6. not so fast*, you need to feed your certbot/ssh/tarsnap keys to make it work!
7. see the README in files/, and your SSH (public) keys must go to public-keys/
8. and you need to update your DNS records, see https://wiki.debian.org/opendkim
9. while OSX is not actually required, it could make your life more beautiful ðŸ¤“
